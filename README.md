## Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of Netflix's movies and TV shows data using SQL. The goal is to extract valuable insights and answer various business questions based on the dataset. The following README provides a detailed account of the project's objectives, business problems, solutions, findings, and conclusions.

## Objectives

--Analyzed the distribution of content types (Movies vs. TV Shows) 
I compared the number of movies and TV shows in the catalog and examined how this distribution varied across different countries.

--Explored content ratings
I identified the most common ratings globally and analyzed the differences between movies and TV shows. Additionally, I observed the distribution of specific ratings by country.

--Assessed production trends over time
I investigated how content production changed over the years, categorizing by content type (movies and TV shows) and ratings.

--Categorized and filtered content based on specific criteria
I classified content as "good" or "bad" based on the presence of keywords in descriptions, identified movies with a runtime of 90 minutes or less, and selected TV shows with only one season.

--Analyzed content distribution by country
I separated countries listed in each row individually and determined the number of pieces of content distributed in each country.

--Grouped content by genre
I counted and listed the number of pieces of content associated with each genre in the listed_in column.
